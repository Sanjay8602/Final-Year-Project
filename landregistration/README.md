# Land Registry Using Blockchain

## Overview

The **Land Registry Using Blockchain** project aims to revolutionize the traditional land registration process by leveraging blockchain technology. This decentralized solution ensures transparency, immutability, and security in property transactions, addressing issues like inefficiency, fraud, and ownership disputes.

## Features

- **Decentralized Land Records**: Transactions and ownership details are stored securely on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of tampering.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates and verifies land transfers, reducing the need for intermediaries.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Ensures all transaction records are tamper-proof.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction for landowners, buyers, and government officials.
- **Enhanced Security**: Data encryption and blockchain technology ensure secure transactions.

## Benefits

- Eliminates fraudulent activities in land registration.
- Reduces delays and paperwork in property transactions.
- Provides a transparent and easily accessible history of land ownership.
- Enhances trust among stakeholders by using a decentralized ledger.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum or Hyperledger
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Front-End**: React.js
- **Back-End**: Node.js
- **Database**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage
- **Development Tools**: Truffle Suite, Ganache
